# macos-accent

> This repository has been archived since Big Sur includes the option to set a multicolor accent colour.

This is a python module that allows you to change the MacOS highlight and accent colours through use of the `defaults` shell command. If you want to call this from the command line, the current reccomended method is by `cd`'ing to the directory where you have stored this module, then running `python3 -c "from macos_accent import <function-you-want-to-call>; <call-the-function>"`.
